we prefer to think about architecture from three fundamental architectual perspectives:


### Domain Architecture

technology-independent decomposition of the business domain into top-level
responsibilities


### Macro Architecture

common platform for service implementations: consistent integration concepts,
communication protocols, data formats, management interfaces

minimal requirements to retain polyglot potential

supports manageability, transparency, monitoring, flexible and fast delivery
and roll-outs


### Micro Architecture

set of design decisions for individual service implementations: frameworks and
libraries, programming languages and other internal aspects
