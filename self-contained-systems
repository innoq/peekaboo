# self-contained systems

based in part on the welcome rediscovery of the [[one-thing-well]] principle
with [[microservices]], self-contained systems (SCS) describe a set of
architectural constraints for creating and managing a landscape composed of
multiple, largely autonomous applications

(aside: the term was
[introduced](https://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2014/11/how-small-should-your-microservice-be/)
by @stilkov, largely for lack of a suitable
[alternative](https://twitter.com/stilkov/status/502488999274225666))

while the basic principles of microservices are now well-understood in the
abstract, the defining characteristics remain somewhat elusive: there's a wide
range of interpretations as to the desirable size of any individual service

regardless, the term "service" usually evokes anemic back-end services, with
UIs and orchestration being largely ignored or relegated to a separate
front-end - however, @stilkov
[argues](http://www.se-radio.net/2014/09/episode-210-stefan-tilkov-on-architecture-and-micro-services/)
that this aspect is vastly underestimated since the UI is actually where much
of the value resides and constitutes a significant factor in determining the
responsibilities of any application

thus self-contained systems explicitly include the UI within the boundary of
individual systems, along with its own data persistence and logic

for web applications, the combination of SCS and [[roca]] allows for
[[web-native-front-end-integration]]

@fnd notes that "[[holocratic]]@fnd systems" seems like a more suitable term,
both in terms of descriptiveness and grammatical flexibility and because it's
less generic/common
